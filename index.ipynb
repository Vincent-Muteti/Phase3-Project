    "### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Rising healthcare costs pose a major challenge for insurance providers, particularly due to high-risk individuals who require frequent and expensive medical care. This project applies Machine Learning Classification techniques to predict high-risk policyholders using demographic, lifestyle, medical, and insurance data. The goal is to enable proactive risk management and improve decision-making within health insurance operations."

    "### Business Problem Statement\n",
    "Health insurance providers face rising medical costs driven by a subset of high-risk policyholders who require frequent and costly healthcare services. Currently, identifying these individuals early remains a challenge, leading to inefficient cost management and reactive care strategies.\n",
    "This project aims to develop a classification model that predicts whether an insured individual is high-risk using demographic, medical, lifestyle, and insurance data. Accurate identification of high-risk individuals will enable the insurer to implement proactive interventions, improve resource allocation, and reduce overall healthcare costs."

    "After addressing data leakage by removing features derived from post-outcome information, a Logistic Regression model was retrained to predict high-risk individuals. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 97%. Importantly, recall for the high-risk class was 97%, indicating that the majority of high-risk individuals were correctly identified. The confusion matrix shows that only a small number of high-risk cases were misclassified, which aligns well with the business objective of minimizing missed high-risk individuals. These results demonstrate that Logistic Regression provides a strong and interpretable baseline for this classification task."

    "To better align model predictions with business priorities, classification thresholds were adjusted to prioritize recall for high-risk individuals. Lowering the decision threshold increased the model’s sensitivity, reducing the likelihood of missing high-risk cases at the cost of a modest increase in false positives. This trade-off is acceptable in an insurance setting, where early identification of high-risk members enables proactive care management and cost containment."
