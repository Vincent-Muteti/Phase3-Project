    "### INTRODUCTION\n",
    "Rising healthcare costs pose a major challenge for insurance providers, particularly due to high-risk individuals who require frequent and expensive medical care. This project applies Machine Learning Classification techniques to predict high-risk policyholders using demographic, lifestyle, medical, and insurance data. The goal is to enable proactive risk management and improve decision-making within health insurance operations."

    "### Business Problem Statement\n",
    "Health insurance providers face rising medical costs driven by a subset of high-risk policyholders who require frequent and costly healthcare services. Currently, identifying these individuals early remains a challenge, leading to inefficient cost management and reactive care strategies.\n",
    "This project aims to develop a classification model that predicts whether an insured individual is high-risk using demographic, medical, lifestyle, and insurance data. Accurate identification of high-risk individuals will enable the insurer to implement proactive interventions, improve resource allocation, and reduce overall healthcare costs."
